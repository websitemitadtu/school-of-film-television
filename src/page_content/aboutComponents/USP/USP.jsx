            Internationally Aligned Cinematic Pedagogy

          <p>
            The curriculum at MITSFT is structured in line with globally
            accepted practices followed by leading international film schools.
            Emphasis is placed on the complete cinematic workflow development,
            pre production, production, and post production ensuring students
            learn filmmaking as a professional, end to end process rather than
            as isolated subjects.

            MITSFT offers over thirty units of professional cameras, editing
            systems, and sound recording equipment, allowing students to work on
            a one to one basis. The School also houses a dedicated shooting
            studio for camera workshops and one of Pune’s largest fully air
            conditioned shooting floors for large scale productions.
