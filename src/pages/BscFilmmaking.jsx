                  The B.Sc. in Filmmaking is a comprehensive undergraduate
                  program designed to develop skilled filmmakers and specialist
                  technicians with a strong foundation in the art and craft of
                  cinema. The curriculum is aligned with contemporary industry
                  practices and follows a production-driven learning model,
                  enabling students to learn filmmaking through direct
                  engagement with real film projects from the first year itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The program offers structured exposure to all core filmmaking
                  disciplines—direction and screenplay writing, cinematography,
                  editing, sound recording and design, and VFX & motion
                  graphics—before students choose their major and minor
                  specializations. This holistic approach ensures a deep
                  understanding of the complete filmmaking process, from concept
                  development to post-production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through intensive workshops, studio-based instruction,
                  collaborative productions, and jury- evaluated film projects,
                  students develop aesthetic sensibility, technical mastery,
                  storytelling ability, and professional discipline. With access
                  to Pune's largest air-conditioned shooting floor and
                  one-to-one use of professional cameras, sound, and editing
                  systems, the program provides an immersive learning
                  environment that prepares graduates for careers across cinema,
                  television, OTT platforms, advertising, and independent
                  filmmaking.

                The B.Sc. in Filmmaking program follows a production and
                project-based learning model that mirrors real-world film
                practice. Students progressively explore all stages of the
                filmmaking process such as Development, Pre-Production,
                Production, and Post- Production through hands-on exercises and
                collaborative projects. Core areas such as Direction &
                Screenplay Writing, Cinematography, Editing, Sound Recording &
                Designing are taught through workshops and supervised film
                productions.

                Each semester culminates in guided short film projects evaluated
                by industry professionals serving as jury members, ensuring
                real-world feedback and professional readiness. The program
                nurtures creative thinking, technical mastery, and teamwork,
