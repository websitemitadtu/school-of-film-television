                  The M.Sc. in Filmmaking is a specialization focused
                  postgraduate program designed for graduates who wish to
                  achieve professional mastery in a specific filmmaking
                  discipline. The curriculum is aligned with contemporary
                  industry practices and emphasizes advanced production
                  workflows, aesthetic refinement, and industry-level execution,
                  enabling students to operate confidently in real-world
                  cinematic environments.
                </p>

                  The program offers in-depth specialization in direction and
                  screenplay writing, cinematography, film editing, sound
                  recording and design, or VFX & motion graphics. Students
                  engage in complex, high-level production projects that
                  simulate professional industry conditions, including concept
                  development, pre-production planning, team leadership,
                  budgeting, and post-production management. This hands-on
                  approach allows students to refine both creative vision and
                  technical expertise while understanding the responsibilities
                  of senior creative and technical roles.

                  A key component of the program is the Master’s capstone film,
                  which serves as an independent, professionally executed
                  project evaluated by a jury of eminent industry professionals.
                  Supported by mentorship, industry interaction, and access to
                  professional infrastructure, graduates of the M.Sc. in
                  Filmmaking emerge as confident practitioners, creative
                  leaders, and independent filmmakers prepared to contribute
                  meaningfully across all platforms where cinema is created and
                  experienced.
